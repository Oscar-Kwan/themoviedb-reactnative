The application will not run without an API key, so please look below for instructions.

For iOS/Android, please also download Expo Client to view the React Native application.

# Retrieving an API Key

Go to [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) website as you'll need an API key to make this application. 

Create an account there and verify the user via email.
After that, follow these steps to grab your API key.


1. Click on your avatar or initials in the main navigation
2. Click the "Settings" Link
3. Click the "API" link in the left sidebar
4. Click "Create" or "click here" on the API page
